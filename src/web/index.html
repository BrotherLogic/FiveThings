	FiveThings is a simple daily task manager. You define five things which you would like to achieve for a single day. 
	You then tick them off when they are complete. When all the tasks are complete you are done and can enjoy the rest of the day.
	Tasks are contained on a single machine for a given user - thus you can define a set of tasks to a single login.

	FiveThings runs on top of JNLP. Click the link below to run and install the program on your machine. You can put it where you wish using the standard
	approach but it should appear in your start menu or applications folder. You will need to <A HREF="java">install java</A> if you have not done so already.
	It will update itself automatically once installed. Once it is installed you can run it from the start menu or application icon.
